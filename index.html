	<h1>Hi there!</h1>
	<p>
		I'm interested in Rust. This exceptional programming language has a serious potential.<br>
		WebAssembly is an excellent opportunity for Rust to become even more popular.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've been keeping my eye on the WebAccembly for a long time and<br>
		when I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJoYZUMOwM4">WebAssembly for the Rust of Us by Jan-Erik Rediger</a><br>
		I've decided to make something on my own and start with simple basic things.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've found a great site with instructions, samples and news about Rust and Wasm <a href="https://www.hellorust.com/">Hello, Rust!</a><br>
		I've begun to reprint pieces of code from the site with minor changes and save them here.
	</p>
	<p>
		On <a href="/posts">this site</a> you can find some Rust and WebAssembly code examples.
