	<h1>Hi there!</h1>
	<p>
		I like Rust, it's an unusual programming language with a lot of potential.<br>
		WebAssembly is an excellent opportunity for Rust to become even more popular.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have long been eyeing the WebAssembly.<br>
		But then I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJoYZUMOwM4">WebAssembly for the Rust of Us by Jan-Erik Rediger</a>.<br>
		And I wanted to write something of my own, to start with something quite simple.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've founded a good site with instructions, samples and news about Rust and Wasm <a href="https://www.hellorust.com/">Hello, Rust!</a><br>
		I began to reprint pieces of code from the site with minor changes and save them here.
	</p>
	<p>
		On this site you can find some Rust and WebAssembly code examples.
